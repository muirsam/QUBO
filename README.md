This is my 2024 Summer Research project.

I am interested in QUBO formulations of optimization/combinatorial problems (particularly graph matching and quadratic assignment).

In order to run this code you will need to install the 'MATLAB Support Package for Quantum Computing'.

NOTE: In order to run the 'sudoku.m' file you must also have the 'sudokuQ.mat' file in the same folder.
